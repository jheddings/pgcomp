    "overview": "Due to the large coal deposits in Poland, the re-supply of coal is larger than in the original game, making coal power plants cheaper to run. Due to their political stands, neither Poland nor Austria will build nuclear power plants. So, a player may only acquire (or even bid on) a nuclear plant when he has cities in at least one of the other three countries. The city of Wien has a special status as it gets all its power from burning garbage - often garbage other countries pay it to take. These changes will offer players new strategies and tactics for this game.",
