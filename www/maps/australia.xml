  <overview>
    Australia does not have a single connected power network. Only in the populated regions
    mainly in the south east are several cities connected to each other. Because of this,
    players may connect to any city for a generally higher connection cost. Australia does
    not use uranium for their power production, but they do mine huge amounts of the
    material to sell to other countries. This offers a completely new game element, even
    for experienced Power Grid players!

  <preparation>
    Resources begin at: coal 1 Elektro, oil 3 Elektro, garbage 4 Elektro.

    There are no uranium spaces in the resource market. The uranium is sold in a separate
    uranium market in Australia. At the start, all 12 spaces of the uranium market are
    filled with 1 uranium each.

    Before preparing the power plant deck, remove the nuclear power plant #17
  </preparation>

  <notes step="1">
    Only the areas of the resource market for 1 to 8 Elektro are used.
  </notes>

  <notes step="2">
    Only the areas of the resource market for 1 to 8 Elektro are used.
  </notes>

  <notes step="3">
    All resources increase by 2 Elektro by moving tokens.  Market spaces for 1 and 2
    Elektro are no longer used.
  </notes>

  <notes>
    Players may connect any available city in the chosen game area for the specified cost
    or general cost of 20 Elektro, plus building costs.

    Uranium mines are not counted towards the plant limit per player and are considered
    when determining the player order.  Sale proceeds in reverse player order. A player may
    decide not to sell his uranium.  Players get money for selling uranium in the last
    round of the game.
