{"name":"Québec","id":"quebec","overview":"The Canadian province Québec places great emphasis on energy production via ecological hydro power plants. Once an ecological power plant has been added to the power plant market, it will remain until purchased by a player or removed when the number on it is lower than the number of cities power by any player. The two cities of Montreal and Québec offer several of cheap connections, making this map challenging with several layers of decisions regarding building the best networks.","limits":[{"players":2,"regionsInUse":3,"maxPlantsPerPlayer":4,"cardsToRemove":8,"step2Trigger":10,"endGameTrigger":21},{"players":3,"regionsInUse":3,"maxPlantsPerPlayer":3,"cardsToRemove":8,"step2Trigger":7,"endGameTrigger":17},{"players":4,"regionsInUse":4,"maxPlantsPerPlayer":3,"cardsToRemove":4,"step2Trigger":7,"endGameTrigger":17},{"players":5,"regionsInUse":5,"maxPlantsPerPlayer":3,"cardsToRemove":0,"step2Trigger":7,"endGameTrigger":15},{"players":6,"regionsInUse":6,"maxPlantsPerPlayer":3,"cardsToRemove":0,"step2Trigger":6,"endGameTrigger":14}],"preparation":[{"players":[2,3,4,5,6],"content":"Resources begin at: coal 2 Elektro, oil 2 Elektro, garbage 7 Elektro, and uranium 14 Elektro."},{"players":[2,3,4,5,6],"content":"After the starting market is prepared, set aside power plants 13, 18, and 22.
