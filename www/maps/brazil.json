    "overview": "In Brazil, power providers prefer biogas for the production of electricity. Thus, players should consider the garbage power plants as biogasfired power plants and the garbage resources as biogas tanks when playing with the Brazil maps. The fight for scarce resources is intense and will keep the players focused during the game!",
