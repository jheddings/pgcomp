    "overview": "The Indian Subcontinent is always in danger of suffering huge power outages if the players increase their networks too fast. Additionally, the players must buy their resources on a limited resource market, which not always guarantees enough resources for all players. The garbage power plants use livestock manure and have a low efficiency. When producing electricity they need one additional garbage.",
