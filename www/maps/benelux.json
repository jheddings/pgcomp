    "overview": "As the Benelux countries are strong supporters of ecological power, the rules change to allow an extra ecological power plant to enter the current market in certain situations. In contrast to Central Europe, Benelux has more oil available, but less coal.  Also, the shorter distances, allow players to build their networks faster, resulting in a shorter game. Finally, the removal of the smallest power plant each round, will push the game faster to step 3.",
